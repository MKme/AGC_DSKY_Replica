# AGC_DSKY_Replica
Mechanically accurate Apollo DSKY replica.

This project is based off the 3D models I re-created from the original MIT Instrumentation Labs drawings (those models can be found on [VirtualAGC's GitHub](https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/mechanical/3D-models)). 
In order to 3D print them, I slightly modified them (widened some holes for brass inserts, keyboard, etc).

A Raspberry Pi running VirtualAGC is doing the grunt work, the display is a simple LCD and the status lights are LEDs.

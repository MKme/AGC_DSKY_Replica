## AGC_DSKY_Replica

Forked From; https://github.com/r1cebank/AGC_DSKY_Replica

Mechanically accurate Apollo DSKY replica.

This project is based off the 3D models I re-created from the original MIT Instrumentation Labs drawings (those models can be found on [VirtualAGC's GitHub](https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/mechanical/3D-models)). 
In order to 3D print them, I slightly modified them (widened some holes for brass inserts, keyboard, etc).

A Raspberry Pi running VirtualAGC is doing the grunt work, the display is a simple LCD and the status lights are LEDs. 



I Will add laser cut keys as well as changes to the Arduino code and display usage.  
 
Posting all files here so someday I can give back to the orginal project

I will doccument the whole build in a Playlist on MKME Lab channel

From http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/download.html#Raspberry_Pi_Raspbian_:
 
this was a helpful bug report https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1103

Here is my discussion with Ron Burkey to make this work.  Thanks Ron!  https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/discussions/1170

Install Raspbian image

Enable SSH, VNC and Serial in sudo raspi-config 

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade 

reboot

sudo apt-get install wx3.0-headers
 
sudo apt-get install liballegro4-dev 

sudo apt-get install libx11-dev

sudo apt-get install git  (already installed) 

sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev 

sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev

sudo apt-get install screen

pip install serial

--fix-missing on anny errors you get (I had several)

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc

cd virtualagc

make clean install

Install provided runAGC.sh run by bash ./runAGC.sh

Install provided ericDSKY.py in /home/pi/virtualagc/piPeripheral/

Code currently in runAGC script is: 

``` 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enabling numlock"
/usr/bin/setleds +num

echo "Starting VirtualAGC"
screen -dm bash -c "cd /home/pi/virtualagc/yaAGC/; ./yaAGC --port=19697 --core=../Colossus249/Colossus249.bin"

echo "Starting DSKY"
cd /home/pi/virtualagc/piPeripheral/
python2 manoDSKY.py
```

Probably not needed anymore:

sudo apt-get install python2

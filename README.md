## AGC_DSKY_Replica

Forked From; https://github.com/r1cebank/AGC_DSKY_Replica

Mechanically accurate Apollo DSKY replica.

This project is based off the 3D models I re-created from the original MIT Instrumentation Labs drawings (those models can be found on [VirtualAGC's GitHub](https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/mechanical/3D-models)). 
In order to 3D print them, I slightly modified them (widened some holes for brass inserts, keyboard, etc).

A Raspberry Pi running VirtualAGC is doing the grunt work, the display is a simple LCD and the status lights are LEDs. 


More on the [Hackaday.io project page](https://hackaday.io/project/174524).

Will add laser cut keys as well as changes to the Arduino code and display usage.  
 
Posting all files here so someday I can give back to the orginal project

I will doccument the whole build in a Playlist on MKME Lab channel

## Assembly

- Print all parts 

## Programming Arduinos

- Program the Arduino NANO with included sketch
- Program Pro-Micro with included sketch

## Programming Pi

Install Raspbian image
Enable SSH, VNC and Serial 
in terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade 
reboot

From http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/download.html#Raspberry_Pi_Raspbian_:
 (this was a helpful bug report https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1103
FYI the Pi will be using YaAGC : https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/yaAGC.html?msclkid=bfcc1461aef711ecba1be6cac11bfc4d

sudo apt-get install wx3.0-headers 
sudo apt-get install liballegro4-dev 
sudo apt-get install git  (already installed) 
sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev 
sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc

cd virtualagc
make clean install

sudo apt-get install python2
pip install serial

/usr/lib/python2.7


Put the python file in it : 
cd /home/pi/virtualagc/piPeripheral/

Still cant run shell from desktop this fixed:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14219092/bash-script-and-bin-bashm-bad-interpreter-no-such-file-or-directory


Now python says serial failed:
pip install serial

sudo su
sudo apt-get remove python3
